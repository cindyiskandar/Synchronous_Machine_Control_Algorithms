# Synchronous_Machine_Control_Algorithms
This Repository contains different MATLAB files representing different control algorithms used for the Synchronous Machine.


"Comm_Vect.m" represents the MATLAB file for the control algorithm with the machine being represented by its datasheet and its equations on Simulink; "Autopilotage.slx", "Comm_vec1111.slx", "Hysteresis.slx" are its control alogirthms Simulink file.

"Model_MS.slx" represents the model of the Synchronous machine on Simulink.

"clarke_conc.m" represents the MATLAB file for the Clarke and Concordia Transformations; "Clarke_Concordia.slx" represents its corresponding Simulink file.
